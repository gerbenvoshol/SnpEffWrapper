# SnpEffWrapper
Takes a VCF and infers annotations and variant effects from a GTF2.2/GFF3 using [SnpEff](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/).

## Notes for the version on this fork
It was forked from sanger-pathogens/SnpEffWrapper on October 2020 and adapted to answer a couple of personal analysis needs. 

### Easy install
A singularity recipe is available and can easily be used to obtain a singularity container by running:

```
sudo singularity build snpEff.sif snpEff.recipe 
```

### Exclusive features compared to original
* Tested with python3
* setup.py was edited so it actually installs with pip
* The Java version check code was changed to match any openjdk version (realistic any recent version will work with SNPeff). Will probably complain if Oracle Java is used.
* the version of SNPeff in the dependencies script was updated (to v4_3t_core)
* the default command line of SNPeff in the wrapper was changed to match my personal needs. (I suggest you have a look at lines 231 and around on snpEffWrapper/wrapper.py to see if this matches your needs) 
* changed code so it doesn't crash if variants don't have an annotation field
* the SNPeff summary CSV is produced and kept 
* added a Singularity recipe file for easy deployment
* Added repo to SingularityHub 
* Added support for GTF2.2 files

## Introduction
SnpEff is a tool that annotates and predicts the effects of variants on genes. SnpEffWrapper takes a VCF and, using SnpEff, infers annotations and variation effects from a GTF or GFF file. If you use SnpEffWrapper, please consider [citing SnpEff](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff.html#citing). This software is not endorsed in any respect by the original authors.

## Installation
SnpEffWrapper has the following dependencies:

 * SnpEff (>= 4.1)
 * Java (>= 1.7)
 * Jinja2
 * PyVCF
 * PyYAML

Details for the installation are provided below. If you encounter an issue when installing SnpEffWrapper please contact your local system administrator. If you encounter a bug please log it [here](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/SnpEffWrapper/issues) or email us at path-help@sanger.ac.uk

Install [snpEff](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/) and Java 1.7 then

```
pip install git+https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/SnpEffWrapper.git
```
### Running the tests
The test can be run from the top level directory:  

```
./snpEffWrapper/tests/test_wrapper.py
```
## Usage
```
$ snpEffBuildAndRun --help
usage: snpEffBuildAndRun [-h] [--snpeff-exec SNPEFF_EXEC]
                         [--java-exec JAVA_EXEC] [--coding-table CODING_TABLE]
                         [-o OUTPUT_VCF] [--debug] [--keep]
                         gff_file vcf_file

Takes a VCF and applies annotations from a GTF2.2/GFF3 using SnpEff

positional arguments:
  annotation_file       GFF3/GTF2.2 with annotations including a reference genome sequence
  vcf_file              VCF input to annotate (NB must be aligned to the reference in your GFF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --snpeff-exec SNPEFF_EXEC
                        Path to your prefered SnpEff executable (default:
                        snpEff.jar)
  --java-exec JAVA_EXEC
                        Path to Java 1.7 (default: java)
  --coding-table CODING_TABLE
                        A mapping of contig name to coding table formatted in
                        YAML
  -o OUTPUT_VCF, --output_vcf OUTPUT_VCF
                        Output for the annotated VCF (default: stdout)
  --debug               Show lots of SnpEff and other debug output
  --keep                Keep temporary files and databases (useful for
                        debugging)
```

* snpEffBuildAndRun will look for SnpEFF.jar in the following locations:
  * the file specified by `--snpeff-exec`
  * `snpEff.jar` in your local directory
  * `snpEff.jar` in your `PATH`
* SnpEff needs Java 1.7 to run; snpEffBuildAndRun will look in the following locations:
  * the file specified by `--java-exec`
  * `java` in your `PATH`

### Example usage
```
$ snpEffBuildAndRun snpEffWrapper/tests/data/minimal.gff snpEffWrapper/tests/data/minimal.vcf -o minimal.annotated.vcf --snpeff-exec /usr/local/bin/snpEff.jar --coding-table 'default: Standard'
```
### Alternative coding tables

You can provide a coding table for each VCF contig otherwise it'll default to SnpEff's 'Bacterial_and_Plant_Plastid'. You can do this by providing a mapping for each contig in your VCF to the relevant table in [snpEffWrapper/data/config.template](snpEffWrapper/data/config.template) in YAML format.

For example:
```
snpEffBuildAndRun minimal.gff minimal.vcf \
  --coding-table 'default: Standard'
  
snpEffBuildAndRun minimal.gff minimal.vcf \
  --coding-table '{CHROM1: Standard, MITO1: Mitochondrial}'
  
snpEffBuildAndRun minimal.gff minimal.vcf \
  --coding-table '{default: Standard, MITO1: Mitochondrial}'
```

NB you don't need curly brackets if you're only mapping one contig (or setting a default); you do need them if you're setting different coding tables.

### Input

* The GFF must contain the reference sequence in Fasta format
* The VCF must be aligned against the reference in the GTF/GFF
* At least one of the contigs in the VCF must have annotation data in the GTF/GFF (you'll get warnings for each VCF config not in the GTF/GFF)
* You cannot provide unknown coding tables (i.e. that can't be found in [config.template](snpEffWrapper/data/config.template))

If your GTF/GFF does not contain the FASTA sequence you can add it to the GTF/GFF as follows:

```
# gff example
bash -c "cat annotation.gff; echo '##FASTA' ; cat reference.fasta" > annotation_with_fasta.gff
# gtf example
bash -c "cat annotation.gtf; echo '##FASTA' ; cat reference.fasta" > annotation_with_fasta.gtf
```
